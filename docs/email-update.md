Tunnelâ€¯Trash Teeâ€¯â€” Printing is underway! ðŸš€

Hello!

Great news: I placed the full production order of shirts today (Mayâ€¯11).
The printer says I should receive the finished shirts by Mayâ€¯26, and Iâ€™ll ship them to you the moment they arrive. You can expect your tracking email between Mayâ€¯26.

Why the extra time? I first ordered a small test batch to confirm the shirt and print quality. That twoâ€‘week check paid offâ€”the samples look awesome, so your shirts will be spotâ€‘on.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at makon@hey.com

Thanks for supporting a oneâ€‘person project and for your patience while I get everything perfect. I canâ€™t wait for you to rock the Tunnelâ€¯Trash tee.

Talk soon with tracking details!
