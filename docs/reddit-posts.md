### Overheard a Vail local brag about “Good Friday was so good without all the Tunnel Trash”—so I made us a tee

Hey everyone—quick story:

Yesterday, while grabbing après drinks at The Flyer Bar at Copper, I overheard someone boasting that their buddy in Vail loved how “Good Friday on the slopes was so much better without all the Tunnel Trash.” I’d never heard the term before and cracked up. I jumped into ChatGPT at the bar, sketched out a shirt concept, and showed it around—every single person I showed it to loved it.

If you’ve ever sat in I‑70 gridlock dreaming of fresh tracks, this one’s for you. Would love to hear what you think of the design, and if you’ve got any other Tunnel Trash war stories!

Stay stoked

## Tunnel Trash Update: The Good, The Bad, and The Bootlegs

r/COsnow!

First, huge thanks to everyone who supported the original Tunnel Trash tee! The response was incredible - I've sold about 25 shirts so far, and I'm stoked so many of you connected with the design.

THE GOOD: The first test batch of shirts arrived. Shirt quality is amazing and the print came out great - here are a few photos from our Flavor Basin trip this weekend.

THE BAD: I woke up the morning after my post went viral to discover at least 20 knockoff websites already selling my design for half what I can even buy blank shirts for... They're offering it in different colors, on mugs, hoodies - you name it.

This is pretty eye-opening. What if I was a struggling artist who spent weeks on this design and site? The internet is wild.

THE FUTURE: I'm placing the final shirt order next week and will ship them out as soon as they arrive. For those interested in grabbing the original design from the actual local creator (printed on Comfort Colors pocket tees), you can find them at tunnel-trash.com for another week.

Thanks again for making this inside joke something special. See you in the parking lot.
